# DyadicSRM-Methods
This repository accompanies my dissertation: *Dyadic Processes Based on the Social Relations Model (SRM) â€“ Second-Stage Analyses.* It contains R scripts, datasets, and output files for two studies:

- **Humility-Creativity Dataset (`Humility-Creativity/`)**  
  Contains R scripts, data files, and reports analyzing how humility influences creativity in dyadic interactions.

- **Listening-Help Dataset (`Listening-Help/`)**  
  Includes R scripts, data, and outcome files related to the effects of listening on helping behavior in dyads.
